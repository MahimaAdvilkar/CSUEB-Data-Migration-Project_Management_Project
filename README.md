- **Objectives**: Define project goals and objectives, conduct kick-off meeting, and identify stakeholders.
  
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Project charter and stakeholder matrix.

### **Phase 2: Needs Assessment and System Design (Weeks 3-4)**
- **Objectives**: Conduct interviews and surveys to gather system requirements.
  
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Requirements document and system specifications.

### **Phase 3: Vendor Selection (Weeks 5-6)**
- **Objectives**: Evaluate vendors through RFPs, finalize contracts.
  
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Vendor selection report and signed contracts.

### **Phase 4: Implementation, Testing, and Training (Weeks 7-9)**
- **Objectives**: Migrate data, conduct system tests, and train staff.
  
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Data migration reports, test results, and training materials.

### **Phase 5: Full Implementation and Project Closure (Weeks 10-12)**
- **Objectives**: Final deployment, feedback collection, and project closure.
  
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Final system deployment, post-implementation review, and project completion report.

## Project Schedule

The migration project spans **12 weeks** and is divided into five key phases:
